H.E.A.P.&trade; is very simple in that the program shows you how to use every available dollar every day to pay down debt on your home mortgage. When you use every available dollar to pay down your debt ALL THE TIME, your daily interest charges are reduced and doing so over the life of a loan has a tremendous compounding effect. This compounding effect will help you reduce the term of your loan by several years and save thousands of dollars in interest.</div><div>Don’t believe it?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span style="font-size:24px;" class="leadstyle-fontsized">Look at the following real world example for a typical American couple:</span></strong></div><div>Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith earn $3,000 collectively twice per month as their take-home pay (after-tax pay which equates to $72,000 after-tax in a dual-income household). Assume they have a $250,000 house with a $200,000 mortgage balance. Assume the interest rate on the loan is 6.25%&nbsp; with a payment of $1,231 a month (without taxes and insurance). Assume the loan has 30 years remaining.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Further, assume that their monthly bills (not including the mortgage) are $3,500 a month.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>How long would it take the Smiths to pay off their mortgage using H.E.A.P.&trade;?</div><div>8.75 years!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>How much would the Smiths save in interest expenses over the life of the loan using H.E.A.P.TM?</div><div>$184,442!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If the above numbers do not get your attention, nothing will.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>H.E.A.P.&trade; is simple, does not require you to change your lifestyle, can save the average client well over $100,000 of interest, and shave in excess of 10 years off the term of a mortgage.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Your H.E.A.P.&trade; numbers</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you would like to have someone run the numbers to determine how much H.E.A.P.TM can save you, simply fill out the form on the right side of this page.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Home Equity Acceleration Plan (H.E.A.P.&trade;)</div><div><br>The Home Equity Acceleration Plan (H.E.A.P.&trade;) was designed to give you a comprehensive yet easy-to-understand roadmap to follow so you can save thousands of dollars in mortgage payments and reduce the time to pay off a mortgage by 5-10-20+ years (without changing your lifestyle).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;Learn about our mobile <b>H.E.A.P.&trade; APP OFFER</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We’ve essentially taken what <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">others charge $3,500</span> in the marketplace for and made it into a mobile app.</div></div>
